## Content Breakdown:

#### Alternative Regions:

Every Region has an alternative Variant in Devoted, these are **completely new Areas** which replace the old ones with a 50/50 Chance
These new Regions have completely unique visuals, enemies and bosses!

-The Alt Region for the Sewers is the Gardens

-The Alt Region for the Prison is the Coldhouse

-The Alt Region for the Caves is the Forge

-The Alt Region for the Dwarven Metropolis is the Dwarven Citadel

-The Alt Region for the Demon Halls is the Ashen Void (this Region is not in the game yet)

#### New Class:

The Zealot is a new class which focuses on **Risk** and **Reward**, they are a full class with all talent tiers, 2 subclasses and 3 armor abilities

-The Zealot starts with a unique Blood Vial Item, with which they can stab themselves in order to fill the vial. They can then drink their own blood to gain a few turns of invincibility.

###### The Zealot has 2 different subclasses:

The Devotee damages enemies and heals every time they stab themselves, this happens based on their wrath, which rises everytime they are hit.

The Archangel summons friendly demons to aid them everytime they drink from their vial. These demons will make enemies more vulnerable to your attacks.

###### The Zealot has 3 different armor abilities:

The Final prayer ability lets you jump away from danger, which gives you a turn of invincibiility and sets your hp to 1. Over time, you will heal back to your max hp. This costs 50% of your armor charge.

Weal and Woe has a 50% chance to upgrade your items massively, and give you other boosts for a few turns. But it also has a 50% chance to degrade your items instead, similar to the Warlocks ability.

Hells Eye summons a giant, stationary eye turret which is more powerful the less hp you have. It will fire zapping beams at enemies from range.

#### New Quest:

There is a new NPC called the Troll Child, which spawns anywhere in the 2nd, 3rd or 4th Region, he offers a new unique, **incredibly difficult** Quest which you can refuse if you dont feel up to the challenge.
This Quest changes for each Class

-The Warrior has to fight the Paladin to obtain the mystical Excalibur Sword

-The Mage has to fight the Evil Sage to obtain the mystical Deathstick

-The Rogue has to fight the Envoy to obtain the mystical Soulgem Ring

-The Huntress has to fight the Spinner Queen to obtain the mystical Gungir

-The Zealot has to fight the Fallen Angel to obtain the mystical Sharanga

#### Misc Changes:

-Devoted contains an overhaul of a lot of different sprites, this is done to make the artstyle mroe consistent, and more appealing

-Devoted adds a button when starting your run, which similar to the challenges and seed buttons appears after beating the game once. This lets you select which regions you want to generate.
